# 🔍 Nudity Detection in Images

Welcome to the **Nudity Detection** project! This is a simple, yet powerful web-based tool built using **React** that allows users to detect nudity in images by either uploading an image or pasting an image URL. It uses a machine learning model to classify the content as **Nude** or **Not Nude**.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This model is currently in development and is **not 100% accurate**. Results should be interpreted with caution and are not recommended for critical use.
